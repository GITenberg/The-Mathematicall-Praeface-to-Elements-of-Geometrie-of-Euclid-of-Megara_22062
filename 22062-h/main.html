<p>The variation in text sizes is as in the original.</p>

<p>In the printed book, all sidenotes were shown in the outer margin.
For this e-text, they have been divided. Text sidenotes&mdash;including
single numerals&mdash;are in the right margin; symbols are on the left,
along with page numbers. The continuous quotation marks could not be
reproduced, so they are shown as oversized open quotes “ and close
quotes ” in the left margin.</p>

<p>The original book did not have numbered pages. Instead it labeled all
recto (right-side) pages, grouped into six eight-page signatures. The
signatures themselves have an unusual sequence: <img src =
"images/finger20.gif" alt = "pointer">&nbsp;(pointing finger);
*&nbsp;(asterisk); a; b; c; A. The verso (left-side) pages were
unmarked; they are identified here as&nbsp;||. The <a href =
"#groundplat">final page</a> was an unnumbered foldout, about twice the
size of a normal page.</p>

<p>Unless otherwise noted, spelling and punctuation are unchanged.
A&nbsp;few specific notes are given <a href = "#textnotes">at the end of
the text</a>, along with those passages of <a href =
"#euclid">Euclid</a> identified by number.</p>

<i>Here is (gentle Reader) nothing (the word of God onely set apart)
which so much beautifieth and adorneth the soule and minde of mã, as
doth the knowledge of good artes and sciences: as the knowledge of
naturall and morall Philosophie. The one setteth before our eyes, the
creatures of God, both in the heauens aboue, and in the earth beneath:
in which as in a glasse, we beholde the exceding maiestie and wisedome
of God, in adorning and beautifying them as we see: in geuing vnto them
such wonderfull and manifolde proprieties, and naturall workinges, and
that so diuersly and in such varietie: farther in maintaining and
conseruing them continually, whereby to praise and adore him, as by
S.&nbsp;Paule we are taught. The other teacheth vs rules and preceptes
of vertue, how, in common life amongest men, we ought to walke
vprightly: what dueties pertaine to our selues, what pertaine to the
gouernment or good order both of an housholde, and also of a citie or
common wealth. The reading likewise of histories, conduceth not a litle,
to the adorning of the soule &amp; minde of man, a&nbsp;studie of all
men cõmended: by it are seene and knowen the artes and doinges of
infinite wise men gone before vs. In histories are contained infinite
examples of heroicall vertues to be of vs followed, and horrible
examples of vices to be of vs eschewed. Many other artes also there are
which beautifie the minde of man: but of all other none do more garnishe
&amp; beautifie it, then those artes which are called Mathematicall.
Unto the knowledge of which no man can attaine, without the perfecte
knowledge and instruction of the principles, groundes, and Elementes of
Geometrie. But perfectly
<span class = "pagenum verso">||</span>
<!-- png 04 -->
to be instructed in them, requireth diligent studie and reading of olde
auncient authors. Amongest which, none for a beginner is to be preferred
before the most auncient Philosopher </i>Euclide<i> of </i>Megara<i>.
For of all others he hath in a true methode and iuste order, gathered
together whatsoeuer any before him had of these Elementes written:
inuenting also and adding many thinges of his owne: wherby he hath in
due forme accomplished the arte: first geuing definitions, principles,
&amp; groundes, wherof he deduceth his Propositions or conclusions, in
such wonderfull wise, that that which goeth before, is of necessitie
required to the proufe of that which followeth. So that without the
diligent studie of </i>Euclides<i> Elementes, it is impossible to
attaine vnto the perfecte knowledge of Geometrie, and consequently of
any of the other Mathematicall sciences. Wherefore considering the want
&amp; lacke of such good authors hitherto in our Englishe tounge,
lamenting also the negligence, and lacke of zeale to their countrey in
those of our nation, to whom God hath geuen both knowledge, &amp; also
abilitie to translate into our tounge, and to publishe abroad such good
authors, and bookes (the chiefe instrumentes of all learninges): seing
moreouer that many good wittes both of gentlemen and of others of all
degrees, much desirous and studious of these artes, and seeking for them
as much as they can, sparing no paines, and yet frustrate of their
intent, by no meanes attaining to that which they seeke: I&nbsp;haue for
their sakes, with some charge &amp; great trauaile, faithfully
translated into our vulgare toũge, &amp; set abroad in Print, this booke
of </i>Euclide<i>. Whereunto I haue added easie and plaine declarations
and examples by figures, of the definitions. In which booke also ye
shall in due place finde manifolde additions, Scholies, Annotations, and
Inuentions: which I haue gathered out of many of the most famous &amp;
chiefe Mathematiciẽs, both of old time, and in our age: as by diligent
reading it in course, ye shall
<span class = "pagenum"><img src = "images/finger20.gif" alt =
"pointer"><ins class = "correction" title = "text reads ‘.ii’">.iij</ins></span>
<!-- png 05 -->
well perceaue. The fruite and gaine which I require for these my paines
and trauaile, shall be nothing els, but onely that thou gentle reader,
will gratefully accept the same: and that thou mayest thereby receaue
some profite: and moreouer to excite and stirre vp others learned, to do
the like, &amp; to take paines in that behalfe. By meanes wherof, our
Englishe tounge shall no lesse be enriched with good Authors, then are
other straunge tounges: as the Dutch, French, Italian, and Spanishe: in
which are red all good authors in a maner, found amongest the Grekes or
Latines. Which is the chiefest cause, that amongest thẽ do florishe so
many cunning and skilfull men, in the inuentions of straunge and
wonderfull thinges, as in these our daies we see there do. Which fruite
and gaine if I attaine vnto, it shall encourage me hereafter, in such
like sort to translate, and set abroad some other good authors, both
pertaining to religion (as partly I haue already done)<br>
and also pertaining to the Mathematicall Artes.<br>
Thus gentle reader farewell.</i></p>

Iuine <i>Plato</i>, the great Master of many worthy Philosophers, and
the constant auoucher, and pithy perswader of <i>Vnum</i>, <i>Bonum</i>,
and <i>Ens</i>: in his Schole and Academie, sundry times (besides his
ordinary Scholers) was visited of a certaine kinde of men, allured by
the noble fame of <i>Plato</i>, and the great commendation of hys
profound and profitable doctrine. But when such Hearers, after long
harkening to him, perceaued, that the drift of his discourses issued
out, to conclude, this <i>Vnum</i>, <i>Bonum</i>, and <i>Ens</i>, to be
Spirituall, Infinite, Æternall, Omnipotent, &amp;c. Nothyng beyng
alledged or expressed, How, worldly goods: how, <ins class =
"correction" title = "‘o’ invisible">worldly</ins> dignitie: how,
health, Strẽgth or lustines of body: nor yet the meanes, how a
merueilous sensible and bodyly blysse and felicitie hereafter, might be
atteyned: Straightway, the fantasies of those hearers, were dampt: their
opinion of <i>Plato</i>, was clene chaunged: yea his doctrine was by
them despised: and his schole, no more of them visited. Which thing, his
Scholer, <i>Aristotle</i>, narrowly cõsidering, founde the cause therof,
to be, <span class = "sidequote begin">“</span>For that they had no
forwarnyng and information, in generall,<span class = "sidequote
end">”</span> whereto his doctrine tended. For, so, might they haue had
occasion, either to haue forborne his schole hauntyng: (if they, then,
had misliked his Scope and purpose) or constantly to haue continued
therin: to their full satisfaction: if such his finall scope &amp;
intent, had ben to their desire. Wherfore, <i>Aristotle</i>, euer, after
that, vsed in brief, to forewarne his owne Scholers and hearers, <span

he tooke in hand to speake, or teach.<span class = "sidequote">”</span>
While I consider the diuerse trades of these two excellent Philosophers
(and am most sure, both, that <i>Plato</i> right well, otherwise could
teach: and that <i>Aristotle</i> mought boldely, with his hearers, haue
dealt in like sorte as <i>Plato</i> did) I&nbsp;am in no little pang of
perplexitie: Bycause, that, which I mislike, is most easy for me to
performe (and to haue <i>Plato</i> for my exãple.) And that, which I
know to be most commendable: and (in this first bringyng, into common
handling, the <i>Artes Mathematicall</i>) to be most necessary: is full
of great difficultie and sundry daungers. Yet, neither do I think it
mete, for so straunge matter (as now is ment to be published) and to so
straunge an audience, to be bluntly, at first, put forth, without a
peculiar Preface: Nor (Imitatyng <i>Aristotle</i>) well can I hope, that
accordyng to the amplenes and dignitie of the <i>State
Mathematicall</i>, I&nbsp;am able, either playnly to prescribe the
materiall boundes: or precisely to expresse the chief purposes, and most
wonderfull applications therof. And though I am sure, that such as did
shrinke from <i>Plato</i> his schole, after they had perceiued his
finall

<p>All thinges which are, &amp; haue beyng, are found vnder a triple
diuersitie generall. For, either, they are demed Supernaturall,
Naturall, or, of a third being. Thinges Supernaturall, are immateriall,
simple, indiuisible, incorruptible, &amp; vnchangeable. Things Naturall,
are materiall, compounded, diuisible, corruptible, and chaungeable.
Thinges Supernaturall, are, of the minde onely, comprehended: Things
Naturall, of the sense exterior, ar hable to be perceiued. In thinges
Naturall, probabilitie and coniecture hath place: But in things
Supernaturall, chief demõstration, &amp; most sure Science is to be had.
By which properties &amp; comparasons of these two, more easily may be
described, the state, condition, nature and property of those thinges,
which, we before termed of a third being: which, by a peculier name
also, are called <i>Thynges Mathematicall</i>. For, these, beyng (in a
maner) middle, betwene thinges supernaturall and naturall: are not so
absolute and excellent, as thinges supernatural: Nor yet so base and
grosse, as things naturall: But are thinges immateriall: and
neuerthelesse, by materiall things hable somewhat to be signified. And
though their particular Images, by Art, are aggregable and diuisible:
yet the generall <i>Formes</i>, notwithstandyng, are constant,
vnchaungeable, vntrãsformable, and incorruptible. Neither of the sense,
can they, at any tyme, be perceiued or iudged. Nor yet, for all that, in
the royall mynde of man, first conceiued. But, surmountyng the
imperfectiõ of coniecture, weenyng and opinion: and commyng short of
high intellectuall cõceptiõ, are the Mercurial fruite of
<i>Dianœticall</i> discourse, in perfect imagination subsistyng.
A&nbsp;meruaylous newtralitie haue these thinges <i>Mathematicall</i>,
and also a straunge participatiõ betwene thinges supernaturall,
immortall, intellectual, simple and indiuisible: and thynges naturall,
mortall, sensible, compounded and diuisible. Probabilitie and sensible
prose, may well serue in thinges naturall: and is commendable: In
Mathematicall reasoninges, a&nbsp;probable Argument, is nothyng
regarded: nor yet the testimony of sense, any whit credited: But onely a
perfect demonstration, of truthes certaine, necessary, and inuincible:
vniuersally and necessaryly concluded:
<span class = "pagenum">*.i</span>
<!-- png 09 -->
is allowed as sufficient for <span class = "sidequote">“</span>an
Argument exactly and purely Mathematical.<span class =
"sidequote">”</span></p>

<p>Of <i>Mathematicall</i> thinges, are two principall kindes: namely,
<i>Number</i>, and <i>Magnitude</i>.
<span class = "sidenote">
Number.</span>
<i>Number</i>, we define, to be, a&nbsp;certayne Mathematicall Sũme, of
<i>Vnits</i>.
<span class = "sidenote smaller">
Note the worde, Vnit, to expresse the Greke Monas, &amp; not Vnitie: as
we haue all, commonly, till now, vsed.</span>
And, an <i>Vnit</i>, is that thing Mathematicall, Indiuisible, by
participation of some likenes of whose property, any thing, which is in
deede, or is counted One, may resonably be called One. We account an
<i>Vnit</i>, a&nbsp;thing <i>Mathematicall</i>, though it be no Number,
and also indiuisible: because, of it, materially, Number doth consist:
which, principally, is a thing <i>Mathematicall</i>.
<span class = "sidenote">
Magnitude.</span>
<i>Magnitude</i> is a thing <i>Mathematicall</i>, by participation of
some likenes of whose nature, any thing is iudged long, broade, or
thicke. <span class = "sidequote">“</span>A&nbsp;thicke <i>Magnitude</i>
we call a <i>Solide</i>, or a <i>Body</i>. What <i>Magnitude</i> so
euer, is Solide or Thicke, is also broade, &amp; long. A&nbsp;broade
magnitude, we call a <i>Superficies</i> or a Plaine. Euery playne
magnitude, hath also length. A&nbsp;long magnitude, we terme a
<i>Line</i>. A&nbsp;<i>Line</i> is neither thicke nor broade, but onely
long: Euery certayne Line, hath two endes:
<span class = "sidenote">
A point.</span>
The endes of a line, are <i>Pointes</i> called. A&amp;nbsp;<i>Point</i>,
is a thing <i>Mathematicall</i>, indiuisible, which may haue a certayne
determined situation.<span class = "sidequote">”</span> If a Poynt moue
from a determined situation, the way wherein it moued, is also a
<i>Line</i>: mathematically produced, whereupon, of the auncient
Mathematiciens,
<span class = "sidenote">
A Line.</span>
a&nbsp;<i>Line</i> is called the race or course of a <i>Point</i>.
A&nbsp;Poynt we define, by the name of a thing Mathematicall: though it
be no Magnitude, and indiuisible: because it is the propre ende, and
bound of a Line: which is a true <i>Magnitude</i>.
<span class = "sidenote">
Magnitude.</span>
And <i>Magnitude</i> we may define to be that thing
<i>Mathematicall</i>, which is diuisible for euer, in partes diuisible,
long, broade or thicke. Therefore though a Poynt be no <i>Magnitude</i>,
yet <i>Terminatiuely</i>, we recken it a thing <i>Mathematicall</i> (as
I sayd) by reason it is properly the end, and bound of a line. Neither
<i>Number</i>, nor <i>Magnitude</i>, haue any Materialitie. First, we
will consider of <i>Number</i>, and of the Science <i>Mathematicall</i>,
to it appropriate, called <i>Arithmetike</i>: and afterward of
<i>Magnitude</i>, and his Science, called <i>Geometrie</i>. But that
name contenteth me not: whereof a word or two hereafter shall be sayd.
How Immateriall and free from all matter, <i>Number</i> is, who doth not
perceaue? yea, who doth not wonderfully wõder at&nbsp;it? For, neither

to serue for Number, as his propre matter. Nor yet the puritie and
simplenes of Substance Spirituall or Angelicall, will be found propre
enough thereto. And therefore the great &amp; godly Philosopher
<i>Anitius Boetius</i>, sayd: <i>Omnia quæcunq<sup>ue</sup>
a&nbsp;primæua rerum natura constructa sunt, Numerorum videntur ratione
formata. Hoc enim fuit principale in animo Conditoris Exemplar</i>. That
is: <span class = "larger"><i>All thinges (which from the very first

English sentence. <i>By Numbers, a&nbsp;way is had, to the searchyng

verifying of which Conclusion, I&nbsp;promise to aunswere to the 74.
Questions, vnder written, by the way of Numbers</i>. Which Cõclusions,
I&nbsp;omit here to rehearse: aswell auoidyng superfluous prolixitie:
as, bycause <i>Ioannes Picus, workes</i>, are commonly had. But, in any
case, I&nbsp;would wish that those Conclusions were red diligently, and
perceiued of such, as are earnest Obseruers and Considerers of the
constant law of nũbers: which is planted in thyngs Naturall and
Supernaturall: and is prescribed to all Creatures, inuiolably to be
kept. For, so, besides many other thinges, in those Conclusions to be
marked, it would apeare, how sincerely, &amp; within my boundes,
I&nbsp;disclose the wonderfull mysteries, by numbers, to be atteyned
vnto.</p>

<p>Of my former wordes, easy it is to be gathered, that <i>Number</i>
hath a treble state: One, in the Creator: an other in euery Creature (in
respect of his complete constitution:) and the third, in Spirituall and
Angelicall Myndes, and in the Soule of&nbsp;mã. In the first and third
state, <i>Number</i>, is termed <i>Number Numbryng</i>. But in all
Creatures, otherwise, <i>Number</i>, is termed <i>Nũber Numbred</i>. And
in our Soule, Nũber beareth such a swaye, and hath such an affinitie
therwith: that some of the old <i>Philosophers</i> taught, <i>Mans
Soule, to be a Number mouyng it selfe</i>. And in dede, in vs, though it
be a very Accident: yet such an Accident it is, that before all
Creatures it had perfect beyng, in the Creator, Sempiternally. <i>Number
Numbryng</i> therfore, is the discretion discerning, and distincting of
thinges. But in God the Creator, This discretion, in the beginnyng,
produced orderly and distinctly all thinges. For his <i>Numbryng</i>,
then, was his Creatyng of all thinges. And his Continuall
<i>Numbryng</i>, of all thinges, is the Conseruation of them in being:
And, where and when he will lacke an <i>Vnit</i>: there and then, that
particular thyng shalbe <i>Discreated</i>. Here I stay. But our
Seuerallyng, distinctyng, and <i>Numbryng</i>, createth nothyng: but of
Multitude considered, maketh certaine and distinct determination. And
albeit these thynges be waighty and truthes of great importance, yet (by
the infinite goodnes of the Almighty <i>Ternarie</i>,) Artificiall
Methods and easy wayes are made, by which the zelous Philosopher, may
wyn nere this Riuerish <i>Ida</i>, this Mountayne of Contemplation: and
more then Contemplation. And also, though <i>Number</i>, be a thyng so
Immateriall, so diuine, and æternall: yet by degrees, by litle and
litle, stretchyng forth, and applying some likenes of it, as first, to
thinges Spirituall: and then, bryngyng it lower, to thynges sensibly
perceiued: as of a momentanye sounde iterated: then to the least thynges
that may be seen, numerable: And at length, (most grossely,) to a
multitude of any corporall thynges seen, or felt: and so, of these
grosse and sensible thynges, we are trayned to learne a certaine Image
or likenes of numbers: and to vse Arte in them to our pleasure and
proffit. So grosse is our conuersation, and dull is our apprehension:
while mortall Sense, in vs, ruleth the common wealth of our litle world.
Hereby we say, Three Lyons, are three: or a <i>Ternarie</i>. Three
Egles, are three, or a <i>Ternarie</i>.
<span class = "sidefinger">
&nbsp;</span>
Which* <i>Ternaries</i>, are eche, the <i>Vnion</i>, <i>knot</i>, and
<i>Vniformitie</i>, of three discrete and distinct <i>Vnits</i>. That
is, we may in eche <i>Ternarie</i>, thrise, seuerally pointe, and shew a
part, <i>One</i>, <i>One</i>, and <i>One</i>. Where, in Numbryng, we say
One, two,

Three. But how farre, these visible Ones, do differre from our
Indiuisible Vnits (in pure <i>Arithmetike</i>, principally considered)
no man is ignorant. Yet from these grosse and materiall thynges, may we
be led vpward, by degrees, so, informyng our rude Imagination, toward
the cõceiuyng of <i>Numbers</i>, absolutely (:Not supposing, nor
admixtyng any thyng created, Corporall or Spirituall, to support,
conteyne, or represent those <i>Numbers</i> imagined:) that at length,
we may be hable, to finde the number of our owne name, gloriously
exemplified and registred in the booke of the <i>Trinitie</i> most
blessed and æternall.</p>

<p>But farder vnderstand, that vulgar Practisers, haue Numbers,
otherwise, in sundry Considerations: and extend their name farder, then
to Numbers, whose least part is an <i>Vnit</i>. For the common Logist,
Reckenmaster, or Arithmeticien, in hys vsing of Numbers: of an Vnit,
imagineth lesse partes: and calleth them <i>Fractions</i>. As of an
<i>Vnit</i>, he maketh an halfe, and thus noteth it, ½. and so of other,
(infinitely diuerse) partes of an <i>Vnit</i>. Yea and farder, hath,
<i>Fractions of Fractions. &amp;c</i>. And, forasmuch, as,

they had no such Roote: and so account them <i>Surd Numbers</i>: which,
generally spokẽ, is vntrue: as <i>Euclides</i> tenth booke may teach
you. Therfore to call them, generally, <i>Radicall Numbers</i>, (by
reason of the signe √. prefixed,) is a sure way: and a sufficient
generall distinction from all other ordryng and vsing of Numbers: And
yet (beside all this) Consider: the infinite desire of knowledge, and
incredible power of mans Search and Capacitye: how, they, ioyntly haue
waded farder (by mixtyng of speculation and practise) and haue found
out, and atteyned to the very chief perfection (almost) of
<i>Numbers</i> Practicall vse. Which thing, is well to be perceiued in
that great Arithmeticall Arte of <i>Æquation</i>: commonly called the
<i>Rule of Coss.</i> or <i>Algebra</i>. The Latines termed it,
<i>Regulam Rei &amp; Census</i>, that is, the <span class =

them, which thinke it to be of <i>Geber</i> his inuentyng: the other of
such as call it <i>Algebra</i>. For, first, though <i>Geber</i> for his
great skill in Numbers, Geometry, Astronomy, and other maruailous Artes,
mought haue semed hable to haue first deuised the sayd Rule: and also
the name carryeth with it a very nere likenes of <i>Geber</i> his name:
yet true it is, that a <i>Greke</i> Philosopher and Mathematicien, named

(aboue 200. yeares ago) inuented. And forasmuch as I am vncertaine, who
hath the same: or when that litle Latin treatise, (as the Author writ
it,) shall come to be Printed: (Both to declare the desire I haue to
pleasure my Countrey, wherin I may: and also, for very good profe of
Numbers vse, in this most subtile and frutefull, Philosophicall
Conclusion,) I&nbsp;entend in the meane while, most briefly, and with my
farder helpe, to communicate the pith therof vnto you.</p>

<p>First describe a circle: whose diameter let be an inch. Diuide the
Circumference into foure equall partes. Frõ the Center, by those 4.
sections, extend 4. right lines: eche of 4. inches and a halfe long: or
of as many as you liste, aboue 4. without the circumference of the
circle: So that they shall be of 4. inches long (at the least) without
the Circle. Make good euident markes, at euery inches end. If you list,
you may subdiuide the inches againe into 10. or 12. smaller partes,
equall. At the endes of the lines, write the names of the 4. principall
elementall Qualities. <i>Hote</i> and <i>Colde</i>, one against the
other. And likewise <i>Moyst</i> and <i>Dry</i>, one against the other.
And in the Circle write <i>Temperate</i>. Which <i>Temperature</i> hath
a good Latitude: as appeareth by the Complexion of man. And therefore we
haue allowed vnto it, the foresayd Circle: and not a point Mathematicall
or Physicall.<a class = "tag" name = "endtag2" id = "endtag2" href =

<p>Now, when you haue two thinges Miscible, whose degrees are * truely

of diuerse. If they be of one Quantitie and waight: whether their
formes, be Contrary Qualities, or of one kinde (but of diuerse
intentions and degrees) or a <i>Temperate</i>, and a Contrary, <i>The

<!-- png 14 -->
the formes mixt</i>. As for example, let <i>A</i>, be <i>Moist</i> in
the first degree: and <i>B</i>, <i>Dry</i> in the third degree. Adde 1.
and 3. that maketh 4: the halfe or middle of 4. is 2. This 2. is the
middle, equally distant from <i>A</i> and <i>B</i> (for the
<span class = "sidenote">
* <i>Note.</i></span>
*<i>Temperament</i> is counted none. And for it, you must put a Ciphre,
if at any time, it be in mixture). Counting then from <i>B</i>, 2.
degrees, toward <i>A</i>: you finde it to be <i>Dry</i> in the first
degree: So is the <i>Forme resulting</i> of the Mixture of <i>A</i>, and
<i>B</i>, in our example. I&nbsp;will geue you an other example.
Suppose, you haue two thinges, as <i>C</i>, and <i>D</i>: and of
<i>C</i>, the Heate to be in the 4. degree: and of <i>D</i>, the Colde,
to be remisse, euen vnto the <i>Temperament</i>. Now, for <i>C</i>, you
take 4: and for <i>D</i>, you take a Ciphre: which, added vnto 4,
yeldeth onely 4. The middle, or halfe, whereof, is 2. Wherefore the
<i>Forme resulting</i> of <i>C</i>, and <i>D</i>, is Hote in the second
degree: for, 2. degrees, accounted from <i>C</i>, toward <i>D</i>, ende
iuste in the 2. degree of heate. Of the third maner, I&nbsp;will geue
also an example: which let be this:
<span class = "sidenote">
Note.</span>
I&nbsp;haue a liquid Medicine whose Qualitie of heate is in the 4.
degree exalted: as was <i>C</i>, in the example foregoing: and an other
liquid Medicine I haue: whose Qualitie, is heate, in the first degree.
Of eche of these, I&nbsp;mixt a like quantitie: Subtract here, the lesse
frõ the more: and the residue diuide into two equall partes: whereof,
the one part, either added to the lesse, or subtracted from the higher
degree, doth produce the degree of the
<span class = "pagenum"> *.iiij </span>
<!-- png 15 -->
Forme resulting, by this mixture of <i>C</i>, and <i>E</i>. As, if from
4. ye abate 1. there resteth 3. the halfe of 3. is 1½: Adde to 1. this
1½: you haue 2½. Or subtract from 4. this 1½: you haue likewise 2½
remayning. Which declareth, the <i>Forme resulting</i>, to be
<i>Heate</i>, in the middle of the third degree.</p>

But if the Quantities of two thinges Commixt, be diuerse, and the
Intensions (of their Formes Miscible) be in diuerse degrees, and
heigthes. (Whether those Formes be of one kinde, or of Contrary kindes,
or of a Temperate and a Contrary, <i>What proportion is of the lesse

betwene the degree of the Forme resulting, and the degree of the greater
quantitie of the thing miscible, to the difference, which is betwene the
same degree of the Forme resulting, and the degree of the lesse
quantitie</i>. As for example. Let two pound of Liquor be geuen, hote in
the 4. degree: &amp; one pound of Liquor be geuen, hote in the third

</span>
Now by the rule of Algiebar, haue I deuised a very easie, briefe, and
generall maner of working in this case. Let vs first, suppose that
<i>Middle Forme resulting</i>, to be 1<span class = "xmath">X</span>: as
that Rule teacheth. And because (by our Rule, here geuen) as the waight
of 1. is to 2: So is the difference betwene 4. (the degree of the
greater quantitie) and 1<span class = "xmath">X</span>: to the
difference betwene 1<span class = "xmath">X</span> and 3: (the degree of
the thing, in lesse quãtitie. And with all, 1<span class =
"xmath">X</span>, being alwayes in a certaine middell, betwene the two
heigthes or degrees). For the first difference, I&nbsp;set 4-1<span
class = "xmath">X</span>: and for the second, I&nbsp;set 1<span class =
"xmath">X</span>-3. And, now againe, I&nbsp;say, as 1. is to 2. so is
4-1<span class = "xmath">X</span> to 1<span class = "xmath">X</span>-3.
Wherfore, of these foure proportionall numbers, the first and the fourth
Multiplied, one by the other, do make as much, as the second and the
third Multiplied the one by the other. Let these Multiplications be made
accordingly. And of the first and the fourth, we haue 1<span class =
"xmath">X</span>-3. and of the second &amp; the third, 8-2<span class =
"xmath">X</span>. Wherfore, our Æquation is betwene 1<span class =
"xmath">X</span>-3: and 8-2<span class = "xmath">X</span>. Which may be
reduced, according to the Arte of Algiebar: as, here, adding 3. to eche
part, geueth the Æquation, thus, 1<span class =
"xmath">X</span>=11-2<span class = "xmath">X</span>. And yet againe,
contracting, or Reducing it: Adde to eche part, 2<span class =

to 11: thus represented 3<span class = "xmath">X</span>=11. Wherefore,
diuiding 11. by 3: the Quotient is 3⅔: the <i>Valew</i> of our 1<span

And that is the heigth, or Intension of the <i>Forme resulting:</i>
which is, <i>Heate</i>, in two thirdes of the fourth degree: And here I
set the shew of the worke in conclusion, thus. The proufe hereof is
easie: by subtracting 3. from 3⅔,
<span class = "figfloat">
<img src = "images/diagram2.png" width = "437" height = "130"
alt = "diagram: see end of text for alternative">
</span>
resteth ⅔. Subtracte the same heigth of the Forme resulting, (which is
3⅔) frõ&nbsp;4: then resteth&nbsp;⅓: You see, that ⅔ is double to ⅓: as
2.<span class = "pmath">P</span>. is double to 1.<span class =
"pmath">P</span>. So should it be: by the rule here geuen. Note. As you
added to eche part of the Æquation, 3: so if ye first added to eche part
2<span class = "xmath">X</span>, it would stand, 3<span class =
"xmath">X</span>-3=8. And now adding to eche part 3: you haue (as afore)
3<span class = "xmath">X</span>=11.</p>

<p>And though I, here, speake onely of two thyngs Miscible: and most

In procedyng first, with any two: and then, with the Forme Resulting,
and an other: &amp; so forth: For, the last worke, concludeth the Forme
resultyng of them all: I&nbsp;nede nothing to speake, of the Mixture
(here supposed) what it is. Common Philosophie hath defined it, saying,
<i>Mixtio est miscibilium, alteratorum, per minima coniunctorum,
Vnio</i>. Euery word in the definition, is of great importance.
I&nbsp;nede not also spend any time, to shew, how, the other manner of
distributing of degrees, doth agree to these Rules. Neither nede I of
the farder vse belonging to the Crosse of Graduation (before described)
in this place declare, vnto such as are capable of that, which I haue
all ready sayd. Neither yet with examples specifie the Manifold
varieties, by the foresayd two generall Rules, to be ordered. The witty
and Studious, here, haue sufficient: And they which are not hable to
atteine to this, without liuely teaching, and more in particular: would
haue larger discoursing, then is mete in this place to be dealt withall:
And other (perchaunce) with a proude snuffe will disdaine this litle:
and would be vnthankefull for much more. I,&nbsp;therfore conclude: and
wish such as haue modest and earnest Philosophicall mindes, to laude God
highly for this: and to Meruayle, that the profoundest and subtilest
point, concerning <i>Mixture of Formes and Qualities Naturall</i>, is so
Matcht and maryed with the most simple, easie, and short way of the
noble Rule of <i>Algiebar</i>. Who can remaine, therfore vnpersuaded, to
loue, alow, and honor the excellent Science of <i>Arithmetike</i>? For,
here, you may perceiue that the litle finger of <i>Arithmetike</i>, is
of more might and contriuing, then a hunderd thousand mens wittes, of

Now, Numbers therfore innumerable, in <i>Numbers</i> prayse, his shryne

<p>What nede I, (for farder profe to you) of the Scholemasters of
Iustice, to require testimony: how nedefull, how frutefull, how
skillfull a thing <i>Arithmetike</i> is? I&nbsp;meane, the Lawyers of
all sortes. Vndoubtedly, the Ciuilians, can meruaylously declare: how,
neither the Auncient Romaine lawes, without good knowledge of <i>Numbers
art</i>, can be perceiued: Nor (Iustice in infinite Cases) without due
proportion, (narrowly considered,) is hable to be executed. How Iustly,
&amp; with great knowledge of Arte, did <i>Papinianus</i> institute a
law of partition, and allowance, betwene man and wife after a diuorce?
But how <i>Accursius</i>, <i>Baldus</i>, <i>Bartolus</i>, <i>Iason</i>,
<i>Alexander</i>, and finally <i>Alciatus</i>, (being otherwise, notably
well learned) do iumble, gesse, and erre, from the æquity, art and
Intent of the lawmaker: <i>Arithmetike</i> can detect, and conuince: and
clerely, make the truth to shine. Good <i>Bartolus</i>, tyred in the
examining &amp; proportioning of the matter: and with <i>Accursius</i>
Glosse, much cumbred: burst out, and sayd: <i>Nulla est in toto libro,
hac glossa difficilior: Cuius computationem nec Scholastici nec Doctores
intelligunt. &amp;c.</i> That is: <span class = "larger"><i>In the whole

What can they say of <i>Iulianus</i> law, <i>Si ita Scriptum.
&amp;c.</i> Of the Testators will iustly performing, betwene the wife,
Sonne and daughter? How can they perceiue the æquitie of
<i>Aphricanus</i>, <i>Arithmeticall</i> Reckening, where he treateth of
<i>Lex Falcidia</i>? How can they deliuer him, from his Reprouers: and
their maintainers: as <i>Ioannes</i>, <i>Accursius Hypolitus</i> and
<i>Alciatus</i>? How Iustly and artificially, was <i>Africanus</i>
reckening made? Proportionating to the Sommes bequeathed, the
Contributions of eche part? Namely, for the hundred presently receiued,
17&nbsp;1/7. And for the hundred, receiued after ten monethes,
12&nbsp;6/7: which make the 30: which were to be cõtributed by the

For, what proportion, 100 hath to 75: the same hath 17&nbsp;1/7 to
12&nbsp;6/7: Which is Sesquitertia: that is, as 4, to 3. which make 7.
Wonderfull many places, in the Ciuile law, require an expert
<i>Arithmeticien</i>, to vnderstand the deepe Iudgemẽt, &amp; Iust
determinatiõ of the Auncient Romaine Lawmakers. But much more expert
ought he to be, who should be hable, to decide with æquitie, the
infinite varietie of Cases, which do, or may happen, vnder euery one of
those lawes and ordinances Ciuile. Hereby, easely, ye may now
coniecture: that in the Canon law: and in the lawes of the Realme (which
with vs, beare the chief Authoritie), Iustice and equity might be
greately preferred, and skilfully executed, through due skill of
Arithmetike, and proportions appertainyng. The worthy Philosophers, and
prudent lawmakers (who haue written many bookes <i>De Republica:</i> How
the best state of Common wealthes might be procured and mainteined,)
haue very well determined of Iustice: (which, not onely, is the Base and
foundacion of Common weales: but also the totall perfection of all our
workes, words, and thoughtes:) defining it,
<span class = "sidenote">
Iustice.</span>
<span class = "sidequote">“</span>to be that vertue, by which, to euery

as God: to be loued, as a father: to be feared as a Lord &amp; master.
Our neighbours proportiõ, is also prescribed of the Almighty lawmaker:
which is, to do to other, euen as we would be done vnto. These
proportions, are in Iustice necessary: in duety, commendable: and of
Common wealthes, the life, strength, stay and florishing.
<i>Aristotle</i> in his <i>Ethikes</i> (to fatch the sede of Iustice,
and light of direction, to vse and execute the same) was fayne to fly to
the perfection, and power of Numbers: for proportions Arithmeticall and
Geometricall. <i>Plato</i> in his booke called <i>Epinomis</i> (which
boke, is the Threasury of all his doctrine) where, his purpose is, to
seke a Science, which, when a man had it, perfectly: he might seme, and
so be, in dede, <i>Wise</i>. He, briefly, of other Sciences discoursing,
findeth them, not hable to bring it to passe: But of the Science of
Numbers, he sayth. <i>Illa, quæ numerum mortalium generi dedit, id
profecto efficiet. Deum autem aliquem, magis quam fortunam, ad salutem
nostram, hoc munus nobis arbitror contulisse. &amp;c. Nam ipsum bonorum

all good things, to be also the cause of the greatest good thyng,
namely, Wisedome?</span></i> There, at length, he proueth
<i>Wisedome</i> to be atteyned, by good Skill of <i>Numbers</i>. With
which great Testimony, and the manifold profes, and reasons, before

<span class = "sidefinger">
&nbsp;</span>
of all Sciences, next to <i>Theologie</i>, it is most diuine, most pure,
most ample and generall, most profounde, most subtile, most commodious
and most necessary. Whose next Sister, is the Absolute Science of
<i>Magnitudes</i>: of which (by the Direction and aide of him, whose
<i>Magnitude</i> is Infinite, and of vs Incomprehensible) I&nbsp;now
entend, so to write, that both with the <i>Multitude</i>, and also with
the <i>Magnitude</i> of Meruaylous and frutefull verities, you (my
frendes and Countreymen) may be stird vp, and awaked, to behold what
certaine Artes and Sciences, (to our vnspeakable behofe) our heauenly
father, hath for vs prepared, and reuealed, by sundry
<i>Philosophers</i> and <i>Mathematiciens</i>.</p>

<p>Both, <i>Number</i> and <i>Magnitude</i>, haue a certaine Originall
sede, (as it were) of an incredible property: and of man, neuer hable,
Fully, to be declared. Of <i>Number</i>, an Vnit, and of
<i>Magnitude</i>, a&nbsp;Poynte, doo seeme to be much like Originall
<span class = "pagenum">a.ij </span>
<!-- png 19 -->
causes: But the diuersitie neuerthelesse, is great. We defined an
<i>Vnit</i>, to be a thing Mathematicall Indiuisible: A&nbsp;Point,
likewise, we sayd to be a Mathematicall thing Indiuisible. And farder,
that a Point may haue a certaine determined Situation: that is, that we
may assigne, and prescribe a Point, to be here, there, yonder. &amp;c.
Herein, (behold) our Vnit is free, and can abyde no bondage, or to be
tyed to any place, or seat: diuisible or indiuisible. Agayne, by reason,
a&nbsp;Point may haue a Situation limited to him: a&nbsp;certaine
motion, therfore (to a place, and from a place) is to a Point incident
and appertainyng. But an <i>Vnit</i>, can not be imagined to haue any
motion. A&nbsp;Point, by his motion, produceth, Mathematically,
a&nbsp;line: (as we sayd before) which is the first kinde of Magnitudes,
and most simple: An <i>Vnit</i>, can not produce any number.
A&nbsp;Line, though it be produced of a Point moued, yet, it doth not
consist of pointes: Number, though it be not produced of an <i>Vnit</i>,
yet doth it Consist of vnits, as a materiall cause. But formally,
<span class = "sidenote">
Number.</span>
Number, is the Vnion, and Vnitie of Vnits. Which vnyting and knitting,
is the workemanship of our minde: which, of distinct and discrete Vnits,
maketh a Number: by vniformitie, resulting of a certaine multitude of
Vnits. And so, euery number, may haue his least part, giuen: namely, an
Vnit: But not of a Magnitude, (no, not of a Lyne,) the least part can be
giuẽ: by cause, infinitly, diuision therof, may be conceiued. All
Magnitude, is either a Line, a&nbsp;Plaine, or a Solid. Which Line,
Plaine, or Solid, of no Sense, can be perceiued, nor exactly by hãd (any
way) represented: nor of Nature produced: But, as (by degrees) Number
did come to our perceiuerance: So, by visible formes, we are holpen to
imagine, what our Line Mathematicall, is. What our Point, is. So
precise, are our Magnitudes, that one Line is no broader then an other:
for they haue no bredth: Nor our Plaines haue any thicknes. Nor yet our
Bodies, any weight: be they neuer so large of dimensiõ. Our Bodyes, we
can haue Smaller, then either Arte or Nature can produce any: and
Greater also, then all the world can comprehend. Our least Magnitudes,
can be diuided into so many partes, as the greatest. As, a&nbsp;Line of
an inch long, (with vs) may be diuided into as many partes, as may the
diameter of the whole world, from East to West: or any way extended:
What priuiledges, aboue all manual Arte, and Natures might, haue our two
Sciences Mathematicall? to exhibite, and to deale with thinges of such
power, liberty, simplicity, puritie, and perfection? And in them, so
certainly, so orderly, so precisely to procede: as, excellent is that
workemã Mechanicall Iudged, who nerest can approche to the representing
of workes, Mathematically demonstrated?
<span class = "sidefinger">
&nbsp;</span>
And our two Sciences, remaining pure, and absolute, in their proper
termes, and in their owne Matter: to haue, and allowe, onely such
Demonstrations, as are plaine, certaine, vniuersall, and of an æternall
veritye?
<span class = "sidenote">
Geometrie.</span>
This Science of <i>Magnitude</i>, his properties, conditions, and
appertenances: commonly, now is, and from the beginnyng, hath of all
Philosophers, ben called <i>Geometrie</i>. But, veryly, with a name to
base and scant, for a Science of such dignitie and amplenes. And,
perchaunce, that name, by cõmon and secret consent, of all wisemen,
hitherto hath ben suffred to remayne: that it might carry with it a
perpetuall memorye, of the first and notablest benefite, by that
Science, to common people shewed: Which was, when Boundes and meres of
land and ground were lost, and confounded (as in <i>Egypt</i>, yearely,
with the ouerflowyng of <i>Nilus</i>, the greatest and longest riuer in
the world) or, that ground bequeathed, were to be assigned: or, ground
sold, were to be layd out: or (when disorder preuailed) that Commõs were
distributed into seueralties. For, where, vpon these &amp; such like
occasiõs, Some by ignorãce, some by negligẽce, Some by fraude, and some
by violence, did wrongfully limite, measure, encroach, or challenge (by
<span class = "pagenum verso">||</span>

pretence of iust content, and measure) those landes and groundes: great
losse, disquietnes, murder, and warre did (full oft) ensue: Till, by
Gods mercy, and mans Industrie, The perfect Science of Lines, Plaines,
and Solides (like a diuine Iusticier,) gaue vnto euery man, his owne.
The people then, by this art pleasured, and greatly relieued, in their
landes iust measuring: &amp; other Philosophers, writing Rules for land
measuring: betwene them both, thus, confirmed the name of
<i>Geometria</i>, that is, (according to the very etimologie of the
word) Land measuring. Wherin, the people knew no farder, of Magnitudes
vse, but in Plaines: and the Philosophers, of thẽ, had no feet hearers,
or Scholers: farder to disclose vnto, then of flat, plaine
<i>Geometrie</i>. And though, these Philosophers, knew of farder vse,
and best vnderstode the etymologye of the worde, yet this name
<i>Geometria</i>, was of them applyed generally to all sortes of
Magnitudes: vnleast, otherwhile, of <i>Plato</i>, and <i>Pythagoras</i>:
When they would precisely declare their owne doctrine. Then, was
<span class = "sidenote">

But, well you may perceiue by <i>Euclides Elementes</i>, that more ample
is our Science, then to measure Plaines: and nothyng lesse therin is
tought (of purpose) then how to measure Land. An other name, therfore,
must nedes be had, for our Mathematicall Science of Magnitudes: which
regardeth neither clod, nor turff: neither hill, nor dale: neither earth
nor heauen: but is absolute <i>Megethologia</i>: not creping on ground,

readily to be holpen and conducted to conceiue, discourse, and conclude
of things Intellectual, Spirituall, æternall, and such as concerne our
Blisse euerlasting: which, otherwise (without Speciall priuiledge of
Illumination, or Reuelation frõ heauen) No mortall mans wyt (naturally)
is hable to reach vnto, or to Compasse. And, veryly, by my small Talent
(from aboue) I&nbsp;am hable to proue and testifie, that the litterall
Text, and order of our diuine Law, Oracles, and Mysteries, require more
skill in Numbers, and Magnitudes: then (commonly) the expositors haue
vttered: but rather onely (at the most) so warned: &amp; shewed their
own want therin. (To name any, is nedeles: and to note the places, is,
here, no place: But if I be duely asked, my answere is ready.) And
without the litterall, Grammaticall, Mathematicall or Naturall verities
of such places, by good and certaine Arte, perceiued, no Spirituall
sense (propre to those places, by Absolute <i>Theologie</i>) will
thereon depend.

First, then, from the puritie, absolutenes, and Immaterialitie of
Principall <i>Geometrie</i>, is that kinde of <i>Geometrie</i> deriued,
which vulgarly is counted <i>Geometrie</i>: and is the <span class =
"larger">Arte of Measuring sensible magnitudes, their iust quãtities and
contentes.</span>
<span class = "sidenote">
Geometrie vulgar.</span>
This, teacheth to measure, either at hand: and the practiser, to be by
the thing Measured: and so, by due applying of Cumpase, Rule, Squire,
Yarde, Ell, Perch, Pole, Line, Gaging rod, (or such like instrument) to
the Length, Plaine, or Solide measured,
<span class = "sidenote">
1.</span>
*to be certified, either of the length, perimetry, or distance lineall:
and this is called, <i>Mecometrie</i>. Or
<span class = "sidenote">
2.</span>
*to be certified of the content of any plaine Superficies: whether it be
in ground Surueyed, Borde, or Glasse measured, or such like thing: which
measuring, is named <i>Embadometrie</i>.
<span class = "sidenote">

*Or els to vnderstand the Soliditie, and content of any bodily thing: as
of Tymber and Stone, or the content of Pits, Pondes, Wells, Vessels,
small &amp; great, of all fashions. Where, of Wine, Oyle, Beere, or Ale
vessells, &amp;c, the Measuring, commonly, hath a peculier name: and is
called <i>Gaging</i>. And the generall name of these Solide measures, is
<i>Stereometrie</i>.
<span class = "sidenote larger">2.</span>
Or els, this <i>vulgar Geometrie</i>, hath consideration to teach the
practiser, how to measure things, with good distance betwene him and the
thing measured: and to vnderstand thereby, either
<span class = "sidenote">
1.</span>
*how Farre, a&nbsp;thing seene (on land or water) is from the measurer:
and this may be called <i>Apomecometrie</i>:
<span class = "sidenote">

Or, how High or depe, aboue or vnder the leuel of the measurers stãding,
any thing is, which is sene on land or water, called <i>Hypsometrie</i>.
<span class = "sidenote">

*Or, it informeth the measurer, how Broad any thing is, which is in the
measurers vew: so it be on Land or Water, situated: and may be called
<i>Platometrie</i>. Though I vse here to condition, the thing measured,
to be on Land, or Water Situated:
<span class = "sidenote">
Note.</span>
yet, know for certaine, that the sundry heigthe of Cloudes, blasing
Starres, and of the Mone, may (by these meanes) haue their distances
from the earth: and, of the blasing Starres and Mone, the Soliditie
(aswell as distances) to be measured: But because, neither these things
are vulgarly taught: nor of a common practiser so ready to be executed:
I, rather, let such measures be reckened incident to some of our other
Artes, dealing with thinges on high, more purposely, then this vulgar
Land measuring Geometrie doth: as in <i>Perspectiue</i> and
<i>Astronomie, &amp;c.</i></p>

<p><span class = "largest">Stratarithmetrie</span>, is the Skill,
(appertainyng to the warre,) by which a man can set in figure,
analogicall to any <i>Geometricall</i> figure appointed, any certaine
number or summe of men: of such a figure capable: (by reason of the
vsuall spaces betwene Souldiers allowed: and for that, of men, can be
made no Fractions. Yet, neuertheles, he can order the giuen summe of
men, for the greatest such figure, that of them, cã be ordred) and
certifie, of the ouerplus: (if any be) and of the next certaine summe,
which, with the ouerplus, will admit a figure exactly proportionall to
the figure assigned. By which Skill, also, of any army or company of

knowne (in Sides and Angles) are not Regular: And where, Resolution into
Triangles can serue. &amp;c. And yet you will finde it strange to deale
thus generally with Arithmeticall figures: and, that for Battayle ray.
Their contentes, differ so much from like Geometricall Figures.</span>
Great pollicy may be vsed of the Capitaines, (at tymes fete, and in

would seme to haue few, (beyng many:) contrarywise, in Figure, and

expert eye, his skill of Ordering <i>Tacticall</i>, the helpe of his
Geometricall instrument: Ring, or Staffe Astronomicall: (commodiously
framed for cariage and vse) He may wonderfully helpe him selfe, by

<p>Thus haue I lightly passed ouer the Artificiall Feates, chiefly
dependyng vpon vulgar <i>Geometrie</i>: &amp; commonly and generally
reckened vnder the name of <i>Geometrie</i>. But there are other (very
many) <i>Methodicall Artes</i>, which, declyning from the purity,
simplicitie, and Immateriality, of our Principall Science of
<i>Magnitudes</i>: do yet neuertheles vse the great ayde, direction, and
Method of the sayd principall Science, and haue propre names, and
distinct: both from the Science of <i>Geometrie</i>, (from which they
are deriued) and one from the other. As <span class =

these to giue some peculier descriptions: and withall, to touch some of
their commodious vses, and so to make this Preface, to be a little
swete, pleasant Nosegaye for you: to comfort your Spirites, beyng almost
out of courage, and in despayre, (through brutish brute) Weenyng that

or engyn, appropriate to a Carpenter, or a Ioyner &amp;c. That the thing
is farre otherwise, then the world, (commonly) to this day, hath demed,
by worde and worke, good profe wilbe made.</p>

<p>Among these Artes, by good reason, <span class =

Apparences</i>, perfect knowledge can be atteyned. And bycause of the
prerogatiue of <i>Light</i>, beyng the first of <i>Gods Creatures</i>:
and the eye, the light of our body, and his Sense most mighty, and his
organ most Artificiall and <i>Geometricall</i>: At <i>Perspectiue</i>,
we will begyn therfore. <span class = "larger">Perspectiue, is an Art
Mathematicall, which demonstrateth the maner, and properties, of all
Radiations Direct, Broken, and Reflected.</span> This Description, or
Notation, is brief: but it reacheth so farre, as the world is wyde. It
concerneth all Creatures, all Actions, and passions, by Emanation of
beames perfourmed. Beames, or naturall lines, (here) I&nbsp;meane, not
of light onely, or of colour (though they, to eye, giue shew, witnes,
and profe, wherby to ground the Arte vpon) but also of other
<i>Formes</i>, both <i>Substantiall</i>, and <i>Accidentall</i>, the
certaine and determined actiue Radiall emanations. By this Art (omitting
to speake of the highest pointes) we may vse our eyes, and the light,
with greater pleasure: and perfecter Iudgement: both of things, in light
seen, &amp; of other: which by like order of Lightes Radiations, worke
and produce their effectes. We may be ashamed to be ignorant of the
cause, why so sundry wayes our eye is deceiued, and abused: as, while
the eye weeneth a roũd Globe or Sphere (beyng farre of) to be a flat and
plaine Circle, and so likewise iudgeth
<span class = "pagenum verso">||</span>

a plaine Square, to be roũd: supposeth walles parallels, to approche,
a&nbsp;farre of: rofe and floure parallels, the one to bend downward,
the other to rise vpward, at a little distance from you. Againe, of
thinges being in like swiftnes of mouing, to thinke the nerer, to moue
faster: and the farder, much slower. Nay, of two thinges, wherof the one
(incomparably) doth moue swifter then the other, to deme the slower to
moue very swift, &amp; the other to stand: what an error is this, of our
eye? Of the Raynbow, both of his Colours, of the order of the colours,
of the bignes of it, the place and heith of it, (&amp;c) to know the
causes demonstratiue, is it not pleasant, is it not necessary? of two or
three Sonnes appearing: of Blasing Sterres: and such like thinges: by
naturall causes, brought to passe, (and yet neuertheles, of farder
matter, Significatiue) is it not commodious for man to know the very
true cause, &amp; occasion Naturall? Yea, rather, is it not, greatly,
against the Souerainty of Mans nature, to be so ouershot and abused,
with thinges (at hand) before his eyes? as with a Pecockes tayle, and a
Doues necke: or a whole ore, in water, holden, to seme broken. Thynges,
farre of, to seeme nere: and nere, to seme farre of. Small thinges, to
seme great: and great, to seme small. One man, to seme an Army. Or a man
to be curstly affrayed of his owne shaddow. Yea, so much, to feare,
that, if you, being (alone) nere a certaine glasse, and proffer, with
dagger or sword, to foyne at the glasse, you shall suddenly be moued to
giue backe (in maner) by reason of an

Image, appearing in the ayre, betwene you &amp; the glasse, with like
hand, sword or dagger, &amp; with like quicknes, foyning at your very
eye, likewise as you do at the Glasse. Straunge, this is, to heare of:
but more meruailous to behold, then these my wordes can signifie. And
neuerthelesse by demonstration Opticall, the order and cause therof, is
certified: euen so, as the effect is consequent. Yea, thus much more,
dare I take vpon me, toward the satisfying of the noble courrage, that
longeth ardently for the wisedome of Causes Naturall: as to let him
vnderstand, that, in London, he may with his owne eyes, haue profe of
that, which I haue sayd herein. A&nbsp;Gentleman, (which, for his good
seruice, done to his Countrey, is famous and honorable:

and for skill in the Mathematicall Sciences, and Languages, is the Od

very willingly, let the Glasse, and profe be sene: and so I (here)
request him: for the encrease of wisedome, in the honorable: and for the
stopping of the mouthes malicious: and repressing the arrogancy of the
ignorant. Ye may easily gesse, what I meane. This Art of
<i>Perspectiue</i>, is of that excellency, and may be led, to the
certifying, and executing of such thinges, as no man would easily
beleue: without Actuall profe perceiued. I&nbsp;speake nothing of

Fixed starre sene, or <i>Planete</i>, in respect of the Earthes
greatnes. As, we are sure (by this Arte) that the Solidity, Massines and
Body of the <i>Sonne</i>, conteineth the quantitie of the whole Earth
and Sea, a&nbsp;hundred thre score and two times, lesse by ⅛ one eight
parte of the earth. But the Body of the whole earthly globe and Sea, is
bigger then the body of the Mone, three and forty times lesse by ⅛ of
the Mone. Wherfore the <i>Sonne</i> is bigger then the <i>Mone</i>, 7000
times, lesse, by 59 39/64 that is, precisely 6940 25/64 bigger then the
<i>Mone</i>. And yet the vnskillfull man, would iudge them a like bigge.
Wherfore, of Necessity, the one is much farder from vs, then the other.
The <i>Sonne</i>, when he is fardest from the earth (which, now, in our
age, is, when he is in the 8. degree, of Cancer) is, 1179 Semidiameters
of the Earth, distante. And the <i>Mone</i> when she is fardest from the
earth, is 68 Semidiameters of the earth and ⅓ The nerest, that the
<i>Mone</i> commeth to the earth, is Semidiameters 52¼ The distance of
the Starry Skye is, frõ vs, in Semidiameters of the earth 20081½ Twenty
thousand fourescore, one, and almost a halfe. Subtract from this, the
<i>Mones</i> nerest distance, from the Earth: and therof remaineth
Semidiameters of the earth 20029¼ Twenty thousand nine and twenty and a
quarter.

So thicke is the heauenly Palace, that the <i>Planetes</i> haue all
their exercise in, and most meruailously perfourme the Commaũdement and
Charge to them giuen by the omnipotent Maiestie of the king of kings.
This is that, which in <i>Genesis</i> is called <i>Ha Rakia</i>.
Consider it well. The Semidiameter of the earth, cõteineth of our common
miles 3436 4/11 three thousand, foure hundred thirty six and foure
eleuenth partes of one myle: Such as the whole earth and Sea, round
about, is 21600. One and twenty thousand six hundred of our myles.
Allowyng for euery degree of the greatest circle, thre score myles. Now
if you way well with your selfe but this litle parcell of frute
<i>Astronomicall</i>, as concerning the bignesse, Distances of
<i>Sonne</i>, <i>Mone</i>, <i>Sterry Sky</i>, and the huge massines of
<i>Ha Rakia</i>, will you not finde your Consciences moued, with the

<span class = "larger"><i>sheweth forth the workes of his

and to Iudge truly of thinges: and notso to expound the Holy word, all
by Allegories: as to Neglect the wisedome, powre and Goodnes of God, in,
and by his Creatures, and Creation to be seen and learned. By parables
and Analogies of whose natures and properties, the course of the Holy
Scripture, also, declareth to vs very many Mysteries. The whole Frame of
Gods Creatures, (which is the whole world,) is to vs, a&nbsp;bright
glasse: from which, by reflexion, reboundeth to our knowledge and
perceiuerance, Beames, and Radiations: representing the Image of his
Infinite goodnes, Omnipotẽcy, and wisedome. And we therby, are taught
and persuaded to Glorifie our Creator, as God: and be thankefull
therfore. Could the Heathenistes finde these vses, of these most pure,
beawtifull, and Mighty Corporall Creatures: and shall we, after that the
true <i>Sonne</i> of rightwisenesse is risen aboue the <i>Horizon</i>,
of our temporall <i>Hemisphærie</i>, and hath so abundantly streamed
into our hartes, the direct beames of his goodnes, mercy, and grace:
Whose heat All Creatures feele: Spirituall and Corporall: Visible and

Inuisible. Shall we (I&nbsp;say) looke vpon the <i>Heauen</i>,
<i>Sterres</i>, and <i>Planets</i>, as an Oxe and an Asse doth: no
furder carefull or inquisitiue, what they are: why were they Created,
How do they execute that they were Created for? Seing, All Creatures,
were for our sake created: and both we, and they, Created, chiefly to
glorifie the Almighty Creator: and that, by all meanes, to vs possible.

This Arte is furnished with many other great Artes and experiences: As
with perfecte <i>Perspectiue</i>, <i>Astronomie</i>,

the Arte of Graduation, and some good vnderstãding in <i>Musike</i>: and
yet moreouer, with an other great Arte, hereafter following,
though&nbsp;I, here, set this before, for some considerations me mouing.
Sufficient (you see) is the stuffe, to make this rare and secrete Arte,
of: and hard enough to frame to the Conclusion Syllogisticall. Yet both
the manifolde and continuall trauailes of the most auncient and wise
Philosophers, for the atteyning of this Arte: and by examples of
effectes, to confirme the same: hath left vnto vs sufficient proufe and
witnesse: and we, also, daily may perceaue, That mans body, and all
other Elementall bodies, are altered, disposed, ordred, pleasured, and
displeasured, by the Influentiall working of the <i>Sunne</i>,
<i>Mone</i>, and the other Starres and Planets. And therfore, sayth
<i>Aristotle</i>, in the first of his <i>Meteorologicall</i> bookes, in
the second Chapter: <i>Est autem necessariò Mundus iste, supernis
lationibus ferè continuus. Vt, inde, vis eius vniuersa regatur. Ea

constant in their periodes. &amp;c.) they assigne a sleight, simple

much, as the <i>Elephant</i> doth, as the <i>Cynocephalus</i>, as the
Porpentine doth: nor will allow these perfect, and incorruptible mighty
bodies, so much vertuall Radiation, &amp; Force, as they see in a litle

Surely, these men, come to short: and either are to dull: or willfully

those most noble corporall Creatures, of their Naturall Vertue: being
most mighty: most beneficiall to all elementall Generation, Corruption

great purpose: and so finish my Annotation <i>Staticall</i>. In
Mathematicall matters, by the Mechaniciens ayde, we will behold, here,
the Commodity of waight.
<span class = "sidenote">
The practise Staticall, to know the proportion, betwene the Cube, and
the Sphære.</span>
Make a Cube, of any one Vniforme: and through like heauy stuffe: of the
same Stuffe, make a Sphære or Globe, precisely, of a Diameter æquall to
the Radicall side of the Cube. Your stuffe, may be wood, Copper, Tinne,
Lead, Siluer. &amp;c. (being, as I sayd, of like nature, condition, and
like waight throughout.) And you may, by Say Balance, haue prepared a
great number of the smallest waightes: which, by those Balance can be
discerned or tryed: and so, haue proceded to make you a perfect Pyle,
company &amp; Number of waightes: to the waight of six, eight, or twelue
pound waight: most diligently tryed, all. And of euery one, the Content
knowen, in your least waight, that is wayable. [They that can not haue
these waightes of precisenes: may, by Sand, Vniforme, and well dusted,
make them a number of waightes, somewhat nere precisenes: by halfing
euer the Sand: they shall, at length, come to a least common waight.
Therein, I&nbsp;leaue the farder matter, to their discretion, whom nede
shall pinche.] The <i>Venetians</i> consideration of waight, may seme
precise enough: by eight descentes progressionall,*

waightes, being ready: fall to worke.❉. First, way your Cube. Note the
Number of the waight. Way, after that, your Sphære. Note likewise, the
Nũber of the waight. If you now find the waight of your Cube, to be to
the waight of the Sphære, as 21. is to 11: Then you see, how the
Mechanicien and <i>Experimenter</i>, without Geometrie and
Demonstration, are (as nerely in effect) tought the proportion of the
Cube to the Sphere: as I haue demonstrated it, in the end of the twelfth
boke of <i>Euclide</i>. Often, try with the same Cube and Sphære. Then,
chaunge, your Sphære and Cube, to an other matter: or to an other
bignes: till you haue made a perfect vniuersall Experience of it.
Possible it is, that you shall wynne to nerer termes, in the
proportion.</p>

<p>When you haue found this one certaine Drop of Naturall veritie,
procede on, to Inferre, and duely to make assay, of matter depending.
As, bycause it is well demonstrated, that a Cylinder, whose heith, and
Diameter of his base, is æquall to the Diameter of the Sphære, is
Sesquialter to the same Sphære (that is, as 3. to 2:) To the number of
the waight of the Sphære, adde halfe so much, as it is: and so haue you
the number of the waight of that Cylinder. Which is also Comprehended of
our former Cube: So, that the base of that Cylinder, is a Circle
described in the Square, which is the base of our Cube. But the Cube and
the Cylinder, being both of one heith, haue their Bases in the same
proportion, in the which, they are, one to an other, in their Massines
or Soliditie. But, before, we haue two numbers, expressing their
Massines, Solidities, and Quantities, by waight: wherfore, we haue
<span class = "sidenote smaller">
* The proportion of the Square to the Circle inscribed.</span>
*the proportion of the Square, to the Circle, inscribed in the same
Square. And so are we fallen into the knowledge sensible, and
Experimentall of <i>Archimedes</i> great Secret: of him, by great
trauaile of minde, sought and found. Wherfore, to any Circle giuen, you
can giue a Square æquall:
<span class = "sidenote smaller">

* To any Square geuen, to geue a Circle, equall.</span>
*If you describe a Circle, which shall be in that proportion, to your
Circle inscribed, as the Square is to the same Circle: This, you may do,
by my Annotations, vpon the second proposition of the twelfth boke of
<i>Euclide</i>, in my third Probleme there. Your diligence may come to a
proportion, of the Square to the Circle inscribed, nerer the truth, then
is the proportion of 14. to 11. And consider, that you may begyn at the
Circle and Square, and so come to conclude of the Sphære, &amp; the
Cube, what
<span class = "pagenum">c.ij </span>

their proportion is: as now, you came from the Sphære to the Circle.
For, of Siluer, or Gold, or Latton Lamyns or plates (thorough one hole
drawẽ, as the maner is) if you make a Square figure &amp; way it: and
then, describing theron, the Circle inscribed: &amp; cut of, &amp; file
away, precisely (to the Circle) the ouerplus of the Square: you shall
then, waying your Circle, see, whether the waight of the Square, be to
your Circle, as 14. to 11. As I haue Noted, in the beginning of
<i>Euclides</i> twelfth boke. &amp;c. after this resort to my last
proposition, vpon the last of the twelfth. And there, helpe your selfe,
to the end. And, here, Note this, by the way.
<span class = "sidenote">
Note Squaring of the Circle without knowledge of the proportion betwene
Circumference and Diameter.</span>
That we may Square the Circle, without hauing knowledge of the
proportion, of the Circumference to the Diameter: as you haue here
perceiued. And otherwayes also, I&nbsp;can demonstrate it. So that, many
haue cumberd them selues superfluously, by trauailing in that point
first, which was not of necessitie, first: and also very intricate. And
easily, you may, (and that diuersly) come to the knowledge of the

ease, and precisenes of the diuision. For, as the number of your first
and lesse line (in your hollow Pyramis or Cone,) is to the second or
greater (both being counted from the vertex) so shall the number of the

Radicall side, of the Cube, dubble to your Fundamentall Cube: Which
being multiplied Cubik wise, will sone shew it selfe, whether it be
dubble or no, to the Cubik number of your Fundamentall Cube. By lines,
thus: As your lesse and first line, (in your hollow Pyramis or Cone,) is

As, of frendes absent, to make a frendly, present comfort: yea, and of

and ayde of Picture? The Architect, the Goldsmith, and the Arras Weauer:
of Picture, make great account. Our liuely Herbals, our portraitures of

<p><span class = "sidenote">
An objection.</span>
<span class = "largest">Architecture</span>, to many may seme not
worthy, or not mete, to be reckned among the <i>Artes Mathematicall</i>.
To whom, I&nbsp;thinke good, to giue some account of my so doyng. Not
worthy, (will they say,) bycause it is but for building, of a house,
Pallace, Church, Forte, or such like, grosse workes. And you, also,
defined the <i>Artes Mathematicall</i>, to be such, as dealed with no
Materiall or corruptible thing: and also did demonstratiuely procede in
their faculty, by Number or Magnitude. First,
<span class = "sidenote">
The Answer.</span>
you see, that I count, here, <i>Architecture</i>, among those <i>Artes
Mathematicall</i>, which are Deriued from the Principals: and you know,
that such, may deale with Naturall thinges, and sensible matter. Of
which, <span class = "sidequote">“</span>some draw nerer, to the Simple
and absolute Mathematicall Speculation, then other do.
<span class = "sidefinger">
&nbsp;</span>
And though, the <i>Architect</i> procureth, enformeth, &amp; directeth,
the <i>Mechanicien</i>, to handworke, &amp; the building actuall, of
house, Castell, or Pallace, and is chief Iudge of the same: yet, with
him selfe (as chief <i>Master</i> and <i>Architect</i>,) remaineth the
Demonstratiue reason and cause, of the Mechaniciens worke: in Lyne,
plaine, and Solid: by <i>Geometricall</i>, <i>Arithmeticall</i>,
<i>Opticall</i>, <i>Musicall</i>, <i>Astronomicall</i>,
<i>Cosmographicall</i><span class = "sidequote">”</span> (&amp;&nbsp;to
be brief) by all the former Deriued <i>Artes Mathematicall</i>, and
other Naturall Artes, hable to be confirmed and stablished. If this be
so: then, may you thinke, that <i>Architecture</i>, hath good and due
allowance, in this honest Company of <i>Artes Mathematicall</i>
Deriuatiue. I&nbsp;will, herein, craue Iudgement of two most perfect
<i>Architectes</i>: the one, being <i>Vitruuius</i>, the Romaine: who
did write ten bookes thereof, to the Emperour <i>Augustus</i> (in whose
daies our Heauenly Archemaster, was borne): and the other, <i>Leo
Baptista Albertus</i>, a&nbsp;Florentine: who also published ten bookes
therof. <i>Architectura</i> (sayth <i>Vitruuius</i>) <i>est Scientia
pluribus disciplinis &amp; varijs eruditionibus ornata: cuius Iudicio
probantur omnia, quæ ab cæteris Artificibus perficiuntur opera.</i> That
is. <span class = "larger">Architecture, is a Science garnished with
many doctrines &amp; diuerse instructions: by whose Iudgement, all
workes, by other workmen finished, are Iudged.</span> It followeth.
<i>Ea nascitur ex Fabrica, &amp; Ratiocinatione. &amp;c. Ratiocinatio
autem est, quæ, res fabricatas, Solertia ac ratione proportionis,
demonstrare atq<sup>ue</sup> explicare potest. <span class =
"larger">Architecture, groweth of Framing, and Reasoning. &amp;c.
Reasoning, is that, which of thinges framed, with forecast, and

Againe. <i>Cùm, in omnibus enim rebus, tùm maximè etiam in Architectura,
hæc duo insunt: quod significatur, &amp; quod significat. Significatur
proposita res, de qua dicitur: hanc autem Significat Demonstratio,

in all thinges: therefore chiefly in Architecture, these two thinges
are: the thing signified: and that which signifieth. The thing
propounded, whereof we speake, is the thing Signified. But
Demonstration, expressed with the reasons of diuerse doctrines, doth
signifie the same thing.</span></i> After that. <i>Vt literatus sit,

<span class = "larger"><i>and the courses Cælestiall, in good
knowledge.</i></span> He geueth reason, orderly, wherefore all these
Artes, Doctrines, and Instructions, are requisite in an excellent
<i>Architect</i>. And (for breuitie) omitting the Latin text, thus he
hath. <span class = "larger"><i>Secondly, it is behofefull for an
Architect to haue the knowledge of Painting: that he may the more
easilie fashion out, in patternes painted, the forme of what worke he
liketh. And Geometrie, geueth to Architecture many helpes: and first
teacheth the Vse of the Rule, and the Cumpasse: wherby (chiefly and
easilie) the descriptions of Buildinges, are despatched in Groundplats:
and the directions of Squires, Leuells, and Lines. Likewise, by
Perspectiue, the Lightes of the heauen, are well led, in the buildinges:
from certaine quarters of the world. By Arithmetike, the charges of
Buildinges are summed together: the measures are expressed, and the hard
questions of Symmetries, are by Geometricall Meanes and Methods
discoursed on. &amp;c. Besides this, of the Nature of thinges (which in
Greke is called <span class = "greek" title =
"phusiologia">φυσιολογία</span>) Philosophie doth make declaration.
Which, it is necessary, for an Architect, with diligence to haue
learned: because it hath many and diuers naturall questions: as
specially, in Aqueductes. For in their courses, leadinges about, in the
leuell ground, and in the mountinges, the naturall Spirites or breathes
are ingendred diuers wayes: The hindrances, which they cause, no man can
helpe, but he, which out of Philosophie, hath learned the originall
causes of thinges. Likewise, who soeuer shall read Ctesibius, or
Archimedes bookes, (and of others, who haue written such Rules) can not
thinke, as they do: vnlesse he shall haue receaued of Philosophers,
instructions in these thinges. And Musike he must nedes know: that he
may haue vnderstanding, both of Regular and Mathematicall Musike: that
he may temper well his Balistes, Catapultes, and Scorpions. &amp;c.
Moreouer, the Brasen Vessels, which in Theatres, are placed by
Mathematicall order, in ambries, vnder the steppes: and the diuersities
of the soundes (which y<sup>e</sup> Grecians call <span class = "greek"
title = "êcheia">ηχεῖα</span>) are ordred according to Musicall
Symphonies &amp; Harmonies: being distributed in y<sup>e</sup>
Circuites, by Diatessaron, Diapente, and Diapason. That the conuenient
voyce, of the players sound, whẽ it came to these preparations, made in
order, there being increased: with y<sup>t</sup> increasing, might come
more cleare &amp; pleasant, to y<sup>e</sup> eares of the lokers on.
&amp;c. And of Astronomie, is knowẽ y<sup>e</sup> East, West, South, and
North. The fashion of the heauen, the Æquinox, the Solsticie, and the
course of the sterres. Which thinges, vnleast one know: he can not
perceiue, any thyng at all, the reason of Horologies. Seyng therfore
this ample Science, is garnished, beautified and stored, with so many
and sundry skils and knowledges: I&nbsp;thinke, that none can iustly
account them selues Architectes, of the <ins class = "correction" title

childes yeares, ascendyng by these degrees of knowledges, beyng fostered
vp with the atteynyng of many Languages and Artes, haue wonne to the
high Tabernacle of Architecture. &amp;c. And to whom Nature hath giuen
such quicke Circumspection, sharpnes of witt, and Memorie, that they may
be very absolutely skillfull in Geometrie, Astronomie, Musike, and the

so wicked a Bargaine. Should&nbsp;I, for my xx. or xxv. yeares Studie:
for two or three thousand Markes spending: seuen or eight thousand Miles
going and trauailing, onely for good learninges sake: And that, in all
maner of wethers: in all maner of waies and passages: both early and
late: in daunger of violence by man: in daunger of destruction by wilde

(as God knoweth): with lodginges, oft times, to small ease: and somtime
to lesse securitie. And for much more (then all this) done &amp;

vpon blinde affection: As, because he knoweth more, then the common
Student: that, therfore, he must needes be skilfull, and a doer, in such

aduaunce his fame: and that you make other men, great marueilers of your

Shake you of, your Folly.
<span class = "sidenote">

<i>Imperfectly zelous</i>, to you, do I say: that (perhaps) well, do you
Meane: But farre you misse the Marke: If a Lambe you will kill, to feede

Fond frends. And farther, I&nbsp;would wishe, that at leysor, you would
consider, how <i>Basilius Magnus</i>, layeth <i>Moses</i> and
<i>Daniel</i>, before the eyes of those, which count all such Studies
Philosophicall (as mine hath bene) to be vngodly, or vnprofitable. Waye

in all maner of wisedome of the Ægyptians: and he was of power both in
his wordes, and workes.</span></i> You see this Philosophicall Power
&amp; Wisedome, which <i>Moses</i> had, to be nothing misliked of the
Holy Ghost. Yet <i>Plinius</i> hath recorded, <i>Moses</i> to be a
wicked <i>Magicien</i>. And that (of force) must be, either for this
Philosophicall wisedome, learned, before his calling to the leading of
the Children of <i>Israel</i>: or for those his wonders, wrought before
King <i>Pharao</i>, after he had the conducting of the
<i>Israelites</i>. As concerning the first, you perceaue, how
<i>S.&nbsp;Stephen</i>, at his Martyrdome (being full of the Holy Ghost)
in his Recapitulation of the olde Testament, hath made mention of
<i>Moses</i> Philosophie: with good liking of it: And <i>Basilius
Magnus</i> also, auoucheth it, to haue bene to <i>Moses</i> profitable
(and therefore, I&nbsp;say, to the Church of God, necessary). But as
cõcerning <i>Moses</i> wonders, done before King <i>Pharao</i>: God, him
selfe, sayd: <i>Vide vt omnia ostenta, quæ posui in manu tua, facias
coram Pharaone. <span class = "larger">See that thou do all those
wonders before Pharao, which I haue put in thy hand.</span></i> Thus,
you euidently perceaue, how rashly, <i>Plinius</i> hath slaundered
<i>Moses</i>,
<span class = "sidenote">
Lib. 30. Cap. 1.</span>
of vayne fraudulent <i>Magike</i>, saying: <i>Est &amp; alia Magices

And (to conclude) most of all, let them be ashamed of Man, and afraide
of the dreadfull and Iuste Iudge: both Folishly or Maliciously to
deuise: and then, deuilishly to father their new fond Monsters on me:
Innocent, in hand and hart: for trespacing either against the lawe of

<p><span class = "dropcap">N</span>Ow end I, with <span class =

may serue for our purpose, sufficiently, at this present. <span class =

Sciences. And bycause it procedeth by <i>Experiences</i>, and searcheth
forth the causes of Conclusions, by <i>Experiences</i>: and also putteth
the Conclusions them selues, in <i>Experience</i>, it is named of some,
<i>Scientia Experimentalis</i>. The <span class =

R.&nbsp;B.</span>
of this land Natiue (the floure of whose worthy fame, can neuer dye nor
wither) did write therof largely, at the request of <i>Clement the
sixt</i>. The Arte carrieth with it, a&nbsp;wonderfull Credit: By
reason, it certefieth, sensibly, fully, and completely to the vtmost
power of Nature, and Arte. This Arte, certifieth by <i>Experience</i>
complete and absolute: and other Artes, with their Argumentes, and
Demonstrations, persuade: and in wordes, proue very well their
Conclusions.* But
<span class = "sidefinger">
&nbsp;</span>
wordes, and Argumentes, are no sensible certifying: nor the full and
finall frute of Sciences practisable. And though some Artes, haue in
them, <i>Experiences</i>, yet they are not complete, and brought to the
vttermost, they may be stretched vnto, and applyed sensibly. As for
example: the Naturall Philosopher disputeth and maketh goodly shew of
reason: And the Astronomer, and the Opticall Mechanicien, put some
thynges in <i>Experience</i>: but neither, all, that they may: nor yet
sufficiently, and to the vtmost, those, which they do, There, then, the
<i>Archemaster</i> steppeth in, and leadeth forth on, the
<i>Experiences</i>, by order of his doctrine <i>Experimentall</i>, to
the chief and finall power of Naturall and Mathematicall Artes. Of two
or three men, in whom, this Description of <i>Archemastry</i> was
<i>Experimentally</i>, verified, I&nbsp;haue read and hard: and good
record, is of their such perfection. So that, this Art, is no
fantasticall Imagination: as some Sophister, might, <i>Cum suis
Insolubilibus</i>, make a florish: and dassell your Imagination: and
dash your honest desire and Courage, from beleuing these thinges, so
vnheard of, so meruaylous, &amp; of such Importance. Well: as you will.
I&nbsp;haue forewarned you. I&nbsp;haue done the part of a frende:
I&nbsp;haue discharged my Duety toward God: for my small Talent, at hys
most mercyfull handes receiued. To this Science, doth the <i>Science
Alnirangiat</i>, great Seruice. Muse nothyng of this name.
I&nbsp;chaunge not the name, so vsed, and in Print published by other:
beyng a name, propre to the Science. Vnder this, commeth <i>Ars
Sintrillia</i>, by <i>Artephius</i>, briefly written. But the chief
Science, of the Archemaster, (in this world) as yet knowen, is an other
(as it were) OPTICAL Science: wherof, the name shall be told (God
willyng) when I shall haue some, (more iust) occasion, therof, to
Discourse.</p>

<p>Here, I must end, thus abruptly (Gentle frende, and vnfayned louer of
honest and necessary verities.) For, they, who haue (for your sake, and
vertues cause) requested me, (an old forworne Mathematicien) to take pen
in hand: (through the confidence they reposed in my long experience: and
tryed sincerity) for the declaryng and reportyng somewhat, of the frute

in matter so slenderly (hetherto) among the common Sorte of Studentes,
considered or estemed.</p>

<p>And where I was willed, somewhat to alledge, why, in our vulgare

Neither are their Studies, hereby, any whit hindred. No more, then the

Lucas de Burgo</i>, or by <i>Nicolaus Tartalea</i>, who in vulgar
Italian language, haue published, not onely <i>Euclides Geometrie</i>,
but of <i>Archimedes</i> somewhat: and in Arithmetike and Practicall
Geometrie, very large volumes, all in their vulgar speche. Nor in
Germany haue the famous <i>Vniuersities</i>, any thing bene discontent
with <i>Albertus Durerus</i>, his Geometricall Institutions in Dutch: or
with <i>Gulielmus Xylander</i>, his learned translation of the first
sixe bookes of <i>Euclide</i>, out of the Greke into the high Dutch. Nor
with <i>Gualterus H. Riffius</i>, his Geometricall Volume: very
diligently translated into the high Dutch tounge, and published. Nor yet
the <i>Vniuersities</i> of Spaine, or Portugall, thinke their reputation
to be decayed: or suppose any their Studies to be hindred by the
Excellent <i>P.&nbsp;Nonnius</i>, his Mathematicall workes, in vulgare
speche by him put forth. Haue you not, likewise, in the French tounge,
the whole Mathematicall Quadriuie? and yet neither Paris, Orleance, or

And surely, the Common and Vulgar Scholer (much more, the Gramarian)
before his comming to the <i>Vniuersitie</i>, shall (or may) be, now

learning of all maner of <i>Philosophie</i>, <i>Academicall</i>, or
<i>Peripateticall</i>. And by that meanes, goe more cherefully, more
skilfully, and spedily forwarde, in his Studies, there to be learned.
And, so, in lesse time, profite more, then (otherwise) he should, or
could do.</p>

Also many good and pregnant Englishe wittes, of young Gentlemen, and of
other, who neuer intend to meddle with the profound search and Studie of
Philosophie (in the <i>Vniuersities</i> to be learned) may
neuerthelesse, now, with more ease and libertie, haue good occasion,
vertuously to occupie the sharpnesse of their wittes: where, els

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
